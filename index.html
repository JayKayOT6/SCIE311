I’ve never liked that function on Facebook, the one that reminds you of what you posted so-many years ago. Most of those posts are dumb decisions by the teenager in me, however this one picture from my past made me smile. This picture meant the world to me back then, with me sat seven other young ladies in the lecture theater only two weeks after we had started university. I recall this picture to be taken as we patiently waited for our first year Engineering Maths lecture to begin, all of us had bonded while studying in the same school of discipline. It got my thinking; just how many girls were with me in first year? I spoke to the School of Engineering and Computer Science at Victoria university to learn that in the 2015 - the I began my study - 364 students who were enrolled in the school studied a compulsory computer science  paper first years, of which 44 students were female. 
<br><br>The one to eight ratio is a lot trust me it was worse. I spoke to Valerie Chan who researched the environment for female students in the Victoria University School of Engineering and Computer Science, it turns out there were a total of 999 male students to 182 female students registered with the faculty. This is actually part of the rising trend for over the past nine years there has been an 8% increase in female students in the faculty. This is promising and the gender disbalance is closing slowly but surely, but there are more ways to increase this such as female representation in computer science and engineering in mass media.

<br><br>Then why did this article one infuriate me? “Meet Karlie Kloss: the supermodel who can code”. A catchy title made me excited; I’m here for women in tech being represented so a super model being acknowledged for her skills as a coder made me happy. Much to my disappointment it only talked about her profession as a supermodel and her passion for cookies with only one sentence dedicated to her career as a computer scientist. I’ve never felt so infuriated at the misrepresentation of a computer scientists, for what message does this pass? I shouldn’t have hoped for so much out of a gossip article but it hurt me to see this is is the perception of computer scientists in our society. STEM has such strong female representation in mass media. There was Hedy Kerr, an actress and inventor; without her discovery of frequency-hopping our wifi and bluetooth wouldn’t work. The Big Bang Theory's Mariam Balick holds a PhD in neuroscience. Natalie Portman has said. "I don't care if [college] ruins my career, I'd rather be smart than a movie star."...so when will we have computer scientists being represent the media?
<br><br>I ask of this for the effect it has on future students. It broke my heart to read Ruth Mesfun’s artivcle on the importance of breaking stereotypes in computer science. “Genius, excellent in math and science, rich, and white.” were the words her students used to describe a software engineer. I spoke to lecturer Xiaoying (Sharon) Ghao about this. Sharon mentioned how schools today try teach coding to students however there isn't much interest from female students “Engineering is for  men is a traditional train of thought...It’s quite prevalent in New Zealand, but not many Kiwi girls like computer science.” 
<br><br>“There’s a very low [entry] rate for female students, between 10-15% in first and second year,” said Sharon. “However this year our course COMP132 Programming for the Natural and Social Sciences has more female students taking the course.” We discussed how many professions today require coding that people do today, biological science being one of them yet it’s interesting how the stigma around computer science is never affects people in that area. It’s very interesting to see how the school will try to counter this. 
<br><br>I still keep in contact with the girls in the picture, two of them are my best friends now. With interests in different areas slowly we will continue to carve a path for the next Hedy Kerr, or the next Margaret Hamilton, or the me who has yet to make a mark on the world.
